# Squid OCI image entrypoint

# This entrypoint aims to forward the squid logs to stdout to assist users of
# common container related tooling (e.g., kubernetes, docker-compose, etc) to
# access the service logs.

# Moreover, it invokes the squid binary, leaving all the desired parameters to
# be provided by the "command" passed to the spawned container. If no command
# is provided by the user, the default behavior (as per the CMD statement in
# the Dockerfile) will be to use Ubuntu's default configuration [1] and run
# squid with the "-NYC" options to mimic the behavior of the Ubuntu provided
# systemd unit.

# [1] The default configuration is changed in the Dockerfile to allow local
# network connections. See the Dockerfile for further information.
